            <p>Here we are at the beginning of a New Year! 2022 is here with all the promise and potential that every
                New Year provides us. Of course, as with every New Year, there are many things that are beyond our
                control. But it is important to focus on what we can control. Among them are our attitudes, our conduct,
                our words, and our goals. </p>
